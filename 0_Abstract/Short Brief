we have some difficulties in obtaining the distance that we want to measure. Even though, measuring tape is an easy option, but this kind of tool will have a limitation 
of manual error. Before this, engineers have produced a range finder module but in the end, they find out the module have many disadvantages like limitation for distance, different result 
for different coloured obstacles, and need a calibration for every time before starts using it. Manual distance measuring is always  done at the expense of human error. 
Precise and fix measurement of low range distance, is the main objective for this project. This device can measure distance in the range of 0.5m to 4m with the accuracy 
of 1cm.This project is used to measure the distance by using ultrasonic sensors.
