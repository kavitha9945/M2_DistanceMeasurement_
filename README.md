# M2_DistanceMeasurement_Using Arduino & HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor:

* In this project, we are going to interface Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 with ATMEGA328P and LCD Display.
* The ultrasonic sensor is used to measure the distance.
* It acts as a Sonar.
* It sends an ultrasonic wave of a certain frequency that comes back after hitting the object and calculates the time traveled by it.
* So letâ€™s learn about Distance Measurement Using ATMEGA 328P & HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor.

## COMPONENTS USED:

1. ATMEGA328P
2. Ultrasonic Sesnor HC-SR04
3. 16*2 LCD Display
4. Breadboard
5. Connecting Wires
6. 5V Power Supply
